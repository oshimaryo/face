# Fix: Improve File Upload Handling and Code Quality for PR #15

## Overview
This document records the improvements made to PR #15 (local file selector feature) to address code quality issues identified during code review.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Error Handling
- Missing error handling for FileReader failures
- No feedback to users when file reading fails

### 2. Performance Concerns
- No file size limits, allowing large files to be stored in browser storage
- Risk of exceeding browser storage limits (5MB Chrome, 10MB Firefox)

### 3. Code Quality
- Duplicated code in `applySettings()` function for Chrome and Firefox
- No null checks for DOM elements
- Japanese text limiting international usage

### 4. User Experience
- No loading indication during file processing
- File input not cleared on errors

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added FileReader Error Handling
```javascript
reader.onerror = () => {
  hideLoadingState();
  alert('Failed to read the file. Please try again.');
  e.target.value = '';
};
```

### 2. Implemented File Size Validation
- Added 500KB file size limit
- Validates before processing the file
```javascript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 500 * 1024; // 500KB
if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
  alert('File size must be less than 500KB');
  e.target.value = '';
  return;
}
```

### 3. Removed Code Duplication
- Extracted common logic into `processResults` function
- Unified Chrome and Firefox code paths
```javascript
const processResults = (results) => {
  // Common processing logic
};

if(window['is_chrome']) {
  browser.storage.local.get(null, processResults);
} else {
  browser.storage.local.get(null).then(processResults);
}
```

### 4. Added Null Checks
- Added null checks for all DOM element operations
- Protected against missing elements
```javascript
if (!preview) return;
```

### 5. Internationalization
- Replaced Japanese text with English
  - "画像ファイルを選択してください。" → "Please select an image file."
  - "ファイル:" → "File:"

### 6. Added Loading States
- Shows "Loading..." during file processing
- Properly clears loading state on success or error
```javascript
const showLoadingState = () => {
  const preview = document.getElementById('image-preview');
  if (!preview) return;
  preview.innerHTML = '<div style="color: #666; font-style: italic;">Loading...</div>';
};
```

### 7. Improved Error Recovery
- File input is cleared on errors to allow re-selection
- Better user feedback with clear error messages

## Files Modified
- `popup/settings.js` - Main logic improvements
- `popup/settings.html` - Japanese to English text change

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various file sizes (especially >500KB)
2. Test file reading errors (corrupt files, permission issues)
3. Verify loading states appear and disappear correctly
4. Confirm all error messages are in English
5. Test on both Chrome and Firefox

## Future Considerations
1. Consider image compression before storing as Base64
2. Add progress bar for large file uploads
3. Support for multiple image formats with validation
4. Consider using IndexedDB for larger storage capacity
