# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files from the root `icons/` directory:

- `face-48.png`
- `face-96.png`
- `face-128.png`

These files need to be copied manually from the root `icons/` directory to `src/icons/` for the Vite build process to work correctly.

## Copy Command
```bash
cp icons/* src/icons/
```
